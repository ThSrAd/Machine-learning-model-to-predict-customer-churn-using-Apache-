#### Case Study</br>
Sparkify is a digital music streaming service provider whose users are able to stream their favorite songs or podcasts.The users can either avail a free tier for the service with advertisements or adverstisement free and offline listening with a premium subscription for a nominal monthly fee. The users are provided with an option to either upgrade, downgrade or cancel their subscription at any time.</br>

What is Churn Rate? </br>
The churn rate is expressed as the percentage of customers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period, usually calculated per month.</br>

The churn rate directly correlates with economy.Even if 1% of users churned in a month, it would result in almost 12% decrease in economy annually.Since Sparkify's business model is heavily reliant on subscription economy it's important to ensure that the user loves the service.
